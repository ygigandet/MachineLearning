## Overview and motivation

For our Machine Learning project, we will be providing a prediction of the Premier League rankings. The Premier League, also known as the English Premier League, is the top level of the English football league system. Contested by 20 clubs, it operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the English Football League. Seasons typically run from August to May with each team playing 38 matches.

## Research questions

We would like to predict the Premium League Results based on the results for the seasons 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19.



Directives on things we need to address in the intro :

" The re-analysis must have new elements (new models, features, outcome labels, approaches, interpretations, etc.). In any case, the data source must be given. If a previous analysis was done in the reference, this analysis must be explained, and the original aspects of the new analysis must be made clear. "
