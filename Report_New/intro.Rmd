# Introduction

The amount of data available in the sports world thanks to technology is constantly increasing. Teams are more and more eager to use this data to their advantage and when speaking about it, we instantly think about the movie "Moneyball". In the movie, a manager of a baseball team picks out undervalued players that should perform well regarding to their statistics. As a result, they win the American League West. Nowadays, this is not an isolated case anymore. 

For our project, we are looking at the Premier League, the top level of the English football league system that is considered as the most powerful in the world, that generates the most wealth and excitement. We would like to find out the key statistics that make a team successful or not by using the supervised and unsupervised models of machine learning.

Obviously, predicting the outcomes of games is not a brand-new field, many betting websites are already doing it. However, in this project we try to assess which statistics and which characteristics are key to these predictions. Then, we model them to build a powerful predicting tool.
